How to run
==========

1. I have assumed that you have used multipipes to run L2 pipeline and have used my version of Driver_module parameter file. 
2. If that's the case, run VIS_groom_6.3.py on the L2 run directory. 
3. If the above run shows "Formatting not carried out." message, run the VIS_cascade_sieve_V.0.4.py script on those directories.
